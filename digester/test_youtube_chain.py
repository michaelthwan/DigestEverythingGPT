        transcript = "if you're into chat gbt you're probably hearing about Auto GPT baby AGI and agents this is essentially GPT on steroids you see we're not hiring interns or assistants anymore now we're building them we're creating them and in this video we're going to talk about all the incredible ways that people are using Auto gbt right now there's also going to be a lot of Great Clips demos to show exactly what they're doing so make sure you stay until the very end solely is using Auto GPT to build a website in less than three minutes and he mentions that the results are so crazy that soon we won't even need a code anymore he also gives more information he mentions that the objective was very simple create a website using react and he does clarify that this was just a basic example to show what's possible it took him one hour to set up a team of smart Engineers could probably make an agent that's a hundred times more complicated Andy mentions took half a day to get it right I tried initially to just prompt it to build a website but it ends up getting stuck in a loop Felipe is also doing something really similar he's using Auto gbt in this case baby AGI to write code combining multiple files and then shortly after he mentions that he made some tweaks to make it a little bit better baby AGI following a detailed description of a small Python program and correctly creating it by managing multiple files with different classes in this version it can write new code edit existing code and run commands for example to install dependencies and this is pretty interesting he says that there are 11 agents in this system One agent allows human feedback before executing each task but it's disabled in this video this can possibly help to get better results from the tasks or skip unnecessary or duplicate tasks which he says happens a lot Omar is using it for sales prospecting and there's four important screenshots in the first one he gives it an objective he says we are a SAS that helps you save time on hiring interviews and in the following screenshots you start seeing how it does the research it compiles everything all the emails the contacts with the final result of drafting an email template for outbound emails to Target companies you're starting to see the trend Auto gbt can do all your busy work such as a to-do list that's how Garrett's using it the thing that he built was that every time you add a task a gpt4 agent is spawned to complete it it already has the context it needs on you and your company and has access to your apps that's also what Linus is using it for he was playing around with god mode and mentions that you can order your coffee at Starbucks perform market analysis and even find and negotiate a lease research is something that auto GPT seems to be pretty good at and that's also why David launched an agent specifically designed for research he gives three examples you can use it to write a podcast script based on the latest news you can also use it to get a market research report and also for new GitHub repos trending on Hacker News when you give it and objective the system will automatically break it down and complete it here's what it looks like if you want to write a script for a podcast but as you can imagine you can write a ton of different content whether it's for a website maybe you're trying to write a book get some more ideas that's what this can help you for and on the academic side if you're a teacher you can use Auto GPT to prepare lesson plans here's another example of an AI agent doing research for you and in this case James is also using Auto GPT to create an agent that researches current affairs and then prepares a podcast framework what about completing goals that's what a seam is doing give your own AI agent a goal and watch as it thinks comes up with an execution plan and takes actions and here's an interesting one Anise is using mobile auto GPT to deploy your own Auto GPT telegram bot you can also create Discord Bots and then the AI agents they can do all the work for you Soul decoder mentioned that this is insane we've added Auto GPT baby AGI in Discord ask our bot a question and it creates AI agents that operate automatically on their own and complete tasks for our marketing and Business Development staff can view output and collab on it very easily he also adds some additional thoughts if you thought Chachi PT was crazy Auto GPT takes it to the next level chains together llm's thoughts has internet access long and short-term memory access to websites and file storage with Discord we can view and even vote on the tasks it gives using emojis John is using it to create Virtual Worlds filled with AI agents this is crazy I ran a 100 agent-wide autonomous simulation of a virtual world as part of a research project for forever voices using nothing but Auto GPT and gpt4 in the second video you'll see that it decides on its own to bring forward an economic crisis among our 100 AI personas as part of the virtual world simulation it's kind of like you're having a bunch of Sims but this time they're a lot more advanced so who knows what they're talking about thinking about and planning to do next David is using in Auto GPT to interact with the blockchain today we signed one of the first ever transactions on the blockchain Via an autonomous AI agent kryptonot GPT is able to understand how to use crypto and send transactions and interact with defy in this example the agent swaps Matic for usdt and here's an interesting one Joshua the CEO of do not pay is using Auto gbt to manage his finances he says that getting a refund canceling a subscription fighting a credit bureau and many other robot lawyer products should be as simple as texting your friend so he gave Auto GPT access to his bank financial statements credit report and email and according to him he's up so far 217 dollars and 85 cents because Auto GPT is helping him save money and he shows exactly how he did it first using a do not pay plot connection I had it log into every bank account and credit card that I own and Scan 10 000 Plus transactions it found eighty dollars and eighty six cents leaving my account every month in useless subscriptions and offered to cancel every single one the Bots got to work mailing letters in the case of gyms chatting automatically with agents and even clicking online buttons to get them canceled you see what's possible it can chat with real agents and it can even click around on a website he gives even more details I asked it to scan the same transactions and find me one where I could get an easy refund from my email it identified a United Airlines in-flight Wi-Fi receipt for 36.99 from London to New York and then asked me did it work properly when I said no it immediately drafted a persuasive and firm legal letter to United requesting a refund the letter was both legalistic citing FTC statutes and convincing a bot then sent it to them via their website within 48 Hours United agreed to refund the 36.99 he keep keeps going I wanted to take a break from saving money and ask gpt4 about my credit score using the array API it got my score and Report without advertisements or trying to sell me a credit card I am currently working on several gbt credit disputes and will report back now it was time to unleash gpt4 on my bills I'm a customer of Comcast and so I asked it to negotiate my bill when Comcast offered a 50 discount the bot pushed back it said no I want more and it got 100 back GPT 3.5 never pushed back for what it's worth and he ends it like this I am already up 217.86 in under 24 hours and have a dozen other disputes pending my goal is to have gpt4 make me ten thousand dollars which one's your favorite let me know in the comments and if you're using Auto GPT right now share your thoughts the results your overall experiences whatever you want that's it I'll see you soon"

        transcript = "foreign school is great for many things like making friends and having fun and memorizing the quadratic formula turn to page 394. but it failed to prepare us for the real world where we've got to do things like manager finances and deal with Annoying managers and figure out what the hell to actually do with our lives so after interviewing a huge range of ridiculously successful people on my podcast from academics to multi-millionaire entrepreneurs to YouTubers to life coaches I've learned so many lessons that I wish we were taught in school and so in this video we're going to go through seven of my personal favorites so the first lesson comes from Tim armu who is an entrepreneur here in the UK and he sold his first company for several tens of millions of dollars at the age of 27. one of the things that I really enjoyed working with you know High performing people is that they just generally have a bias towards action they know that they can try several things and maybe quite a few of them would flop but they're not concerned with that they're just concerned with taking as many shots on go so the thing School teaches us is to be very risk-averse because of the system of grading and assignments we put in a lot of effort and then we hand it in and then we get a grade back and often that grading system can lead to a lot of perfectionism and a lot of anxiety especially when leaderboards and rankings and stuff are involved when we get an assignment at school there's usually a deadline and there are no prizes for getting in the thing early or for doing twice as many or 10 times as many things all that matters is just that one piece of packaging that little thing that you hand to the teacher and then the grade you and that's just not how things work in the real world in the real world if you want to succeed a lot of it is about just doing lots and lots and lots of the thing that you're trying to do like if you're trying to make a career in almost any creative field it's way more important that you try and get lots of clients and get lots of practice in then you spend absolutely ages trying to hone and perfect that one specific thing and definitely one of the characteristics of the most successful people I have ever met and interviewed through the podcast or anything else is just that they have this bias towards action they spend a lot less time overthinking doing the thing and a lot more time actually doing the thing and one of the lessons that I've really learned over the last six years of growing this YouTube channel is that action is really the foundation and overthinking can be sprinkled on top of it it's something I say to my students in my part-time YouTuber Academy that you're allowed to overthink your Niche or whatever your strategy or you like as long as you are taking action but if you're trying to do all of the strategy stuff and trying to think a lot before you even do anything at all then you're not really going to get anywhere and there's a nice quote that I often think about which is that it's a lot easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary ship so if you right now are struggling with something where you are staying stationary and you're letting overthinking paralyze you from taking action recognize that it's way easier to change Course once you've already started moving so have that bias towards action oh by the way quick thing as a bit of a celebration for hitting four million subscribers and as a thank you for you guys we are giving away an enormous amount of stuff to one lucky winner as part of the productivity booster kit so we are giving away this M2 Chip 13-inch MacBook Pro along with some airpod pros along with a pen along with some of my

tools and books and stuff that I've read but yeah you can join the giveaway and then one lucky person will get all of this stuff ship to them almost anywhere in the world there are a few places where we cannot ship stuff because of various postal constraints that are outside of our controls apologies for that but all the details are on the giveaway page where you can check that out if you want to win all this stuff so thanks again for letting us hit 4 million subscribers you guys are the best lesson number two comes from Alex hormozzi who is another entrepreneur with a net worth of over 100 million dollars for whatever that's worth and this is what he had to say it's a whole S P 500 versus SME 500 but like you will get a significantly higher return investing in your own ability to make money than you will in any any Market you will get outsized Returns on the on the information right on the knowledge and the lessons that you will learn and so you want to you want to pay that ignorance down as fast as you can because as soon as you have that knowledge you'll be able to Skyrocket straight to 20 50 100 500 000 a month like very quickly because you know how to do it so the thing that school encourages us to do is to treat school as our learning time and then treat our career as our earning time and often people will be looking at things like oh I could get this job because the starting salary is X so you know this kind of stuff but really learning is a lifelong Endeavor and especially after you leave school and when you actually join the workforce or you actually try to start a business that is where the bulk of your learning is really done like in medicine for example you spend six years in medical school but the first two weeks that you're actually working as a doctor the amount of stuff you learn in that two weeks is like way way way more dense and way more like immediately accessible than the stuff that you learn in six years of medical school and one of the key points that hormuzi says is really about this idea that as you're going through your career Journey you're always trying to pay down ignorance debt like the reason that you don't make 10 million dollars a year right now I suspect is because you just don't know how to make 10 million dollars a year and therefore not knowing how to make 10 million a year is costing you and me around 10 million a year it's like there's this whole ignorance debt that we have to pay off and the people who making a million or 10 million a year are the ones who know how to do it so for example let's say you happen to have a hundred dollars to spare you could decide to invest the money by putting it into the S P 500 and then it grows at five to seven percent a year or you can instead take that 100 and invest it in improving and learning your own skills and the return on that is way higher than the value you're going to get putting it in stock market index funds like you could spend that hundred dollars on buying 10 business books that are all about how to get rich if you want to make money and those would give you way higher returns than the poultry returns you're going to get in the stock market and then even in the jobs that you choose you really want to prioritize learning rather than earning especially towards the start of your career so in this video we've been talking about loads of different ways in which you can learn the skills that scored and teach you and if you're looking for a platform to learn the skills on then you might like to check out skillshare who

productively learning path on skillshare and thank you so much skillshare for sponsoring this video alright lesson number three comes from Grace Beverly who is another multi-millionaire entrepreneur I happen to interview a lot of these people on the podcast and grace started off her career as a fitness influencer and is now running two hugely successful companies and this is her take on self-care so I think that's one of the like one of the main triggers for the book was actually the fact that like people would be like oh self-care relax and I'd be like actually sometimes self-care is meeting that deadline that you're currently not on track to meet but actually respecting your future self and your goals is getting them up and doing the work that you need to do for that and like we cannot Market self-care as always like doing nothing sometimes self-care is working harder because you're currently not working in line with what you want to make happen so school doesn't teach us a lot about the idea of self-care or about how to look after ourselves but occasionally in like lessons in school and even sometimes at University you'll get the idea that self-care is like making time for yourself and having a bath and taking a mindful walk in nature and all of that kind of fun stuff and while that stuff is important I think Grace's Point here is that often what self-care looks like is productivity sometimes self-care is genuinely working harder than you currently are because actually you want to be at a certain place and you know that being at that place will ease up some kind of stress in your life maybe it's financial and so in those contexts best form of self-care is maybe to start that side hustle or to get a little bit better at your job rather than doing a binge of three hours of whatever on Netflix alright tip number four is another piece of career advice that they often don't teach you in school and this comes from Daniel Priestley who is another multi-millionaire serial entrepreneur and a book author and here is what he recommends about your first job outside of school or university it's it's massively useful to join someone else's startup like I would highly recommend that to absolutely anyone so here's what goes wrong with a lot of young people they go to careers fairs and all that sort of stuff it's only big corporates that exhibit so they end up being funneled down the big corporate uh path you know just things like how do you send out like a big bulk email to a list or where do you get a list from or like how do you sit down and have a lunch and negotiate a joint venture for me my two years doing that when I was 19 to 21 I actually got to sit in on those meetings so school and University and career counselors tend to only really encourage us to work for big corporations because big corporations are generally the only ones who can afford to have there to have the talks at the universities that have their brochures displayed at careers fairs big corporations are also the ones that career counselors are going to be more familiar with but relatively speaking there's only a tiny number of companies that are actually big corporations and there are millions more that are small businesses that have between 0 and 10 employees now the issue with getting a corporate job is that you are a very small Cog in a very very big machine and so your capacity for learning is actually very limited because it's confined to learning within your own role or learning within the role of just like your direct manager whereas if you join a small startup instead that has fewer than 10 employees you'll suddenly learn everything about the whole business you'll probably get visibility over the revenue and the profits and how the company's thinking about setting goals and how management works and how leadership works and how hiring and firing and onboarding and accounting and all the different skills associated with running a business work so that even if you don't aspire to run your own business someday but especially if you do working at a small startup instead of maybe a corporation massively levels up your ability to learn and this is true even if the big Corporation is fancy and the small company is Tiny like for example you'd probably learn way more about business by working for a small plumbing company than you would learning about a massive industry that you're a small Coggin if you joined a big management consulting firm for example and the great thing is you can always join the big Corporation later on once you've learned those interesting skills about how to run a business that you've learned from working at a startup but often if you work for a big Corporation you get the gold on handcuffs then you're like you're used to a certain standard of living and they pay loads of money and then you won't want to take a pay cut in the future whereas straight out of University or straight out of school that's the best time to work for these small businesses oh and if you're enjoying these tips so far I would love it if you can drop a cheeky thumbs up on the video it really helps support the channel alright tip number five comes from Professor Grace Lorden who is a professor of Behavioral economic X at the London School of economics and she has written this fantastic book think big take small steps and build the future you want which is really about evidence-based career advice and this is what she has to say about choosing a career because I've noticed a lot of times when I talk to people about careers they're attached to a label so they want to be a Trader or an investment banker or they want to be a doctor or they're attached to a lifestyle so they want to be able to go on a particular vacation or buy a particular car and the kind of think big journey is really thinking about if I were to be a doctor if I were to be a Trader what would be the tasks that I would be doing on a day-to-day basis and would I ultimately end up enjoying those tasks so the activities that I'm going to spend the time in and again School encourages us to focus on the title if a career counselor asks what you want to be when you grow up they might expect you to say Banker or lawyer or doctor or engineer or that kind of thing and all these are really just titles like they don't actually tell you very much about what you're going to be doing day to day but what basically all the evidence from Behavioral Science says is that if you really want to build a career that you love and feel fulfilled in your career it's a lot more about the actions that you're taking day to day rather than what job title is on your business card and so this idea of task Centric rather than title-centric career planning is another skill that you can learn outside of school that you should learn outside of school that school is almost never going to teach you all right for tip number six we are back to Tim armu the entrepreneur who sold his company for several tens of millions at the age of 27. but it's very important to focus on like the skills and actually cultivating skills which can then lead to money which is things like you know marketing and sales and uh copywriting things like that like you want to focus on just like being off used to the economy because if you're of like General use in some way people will pay you for that and like that's the way that you create value so the things that we learn in school tend not to be correlated with the things that actually contribute to Career or economical or financial success and so if you're trying to make money or trying to get rich or whatever the thing might be it's worth appreciating what are the skills specifically that increase your own personal stock price that increase your ability to add value value to the economy and that therefore will increase the salary that you can earn if you're an employee and also the profits you can generate if you start your own business so for example in school you can learn a lot about maths and calculus and stuff but you learned very little about reading a financial balance sheet or even about using a program like Microsoft Excel which is actually a hugely valuable skill for the economy in history you might learn about the kings and queens of England but you're unlikely to learn about the rise and fall of different economic and financial systems which again is knowledge that is more directly applicable and will be more likely to help you if you do have the goal of making money further down the line and so really after school it comes back to this point of learning you want to learn the skills that will improve your own ability to be successful in whatever field you set your mind to oh by the way just in case you didn't know I actually have a podcast it's called Deep dive with Ali abdall where I've done these interviews from and that is available completely for free on any podcast app including its very own YouTube channel so if you're like me and you Vibe with the idea of lifelong learning then you can listen in as I personally learn from all of these people that I'm interviewing and then tip number seven comes from professional poker player author and entrepreneur Chris Sparks and I think a lot of success and life comes down to playing in the right game playing in the place that you have some sort of advantage and even if that Advantage is you just enjoy doing this more you have more fun at it that's your your have an easier time dedicating yourself to it putting yourself into it no I love this I love this idea of exploiting your competitive or unfair advantages this I think is one of the biggest things that makes the difference between successful entrepreneurs or creators and the less successful ones in that generally the successful ones have found a way to exploit some kind of natural advantage and the problem with school is that it encourages everyone to pursue similar things there's a national curriculum you get a defined list of things that you have to do in the real world True Value is unlocked by just being really good at one specific thing and really really really doubling down on it like Roger Federer does not need to be an all-rounder he adds value to the world and to the economy by just being really good at one specific thing similarly if you're trying to build a business you don't try and need to be something to everyone you don't try and need to make the next Amazon or the next Walmart that's trying to sell everything you just have to be very good at doing one specific service or making one specific product and it can be super Niche but if you have an unfair advantage in that space it's way easier to be successful exploiting that unfair Advantage than it is to become successful by kind of slowly Shoring up the general areas that you're weaken now at this point you might be thinking okay cool but like to learn all this stuff which is what we seem to be emphasizing in this video we need to manage our time pretty well and we need to find a way to make more time and so this video is how I get the absolute most out of my time so thank you for watching and I will see you there"
